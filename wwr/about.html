            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2025 by outdoor enthusiasts Daniel and Lauretta, Rapids Adventure Company began as a small family operation with just two rafts and a dream to share their love of white water rafting with others. What started as weekend trips for
                friends and family has grown into one of the region's most trusted and respected rafting outfitters.</p>
            <p>Over the past four decades, we've safely guided over 50,000 adventurers down some of the most spectacular rivers in the country. Our commitment to safety, environmental conservation, and exceptional customer service has earned us numerous
                awards and certifications. Today, we operate with a fleet of 25 rafts and employ over 30 certified guides who share our passion for adventure and respect for the natural world.</p>
